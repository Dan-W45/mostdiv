The fact that I cannot use icons in the sidebar is driving me up the wall
I would simply like to use the status-online: {{< icon "status-online" >}}
and status-offline: {{< icon "status-offline" >}} icons in the left sidebar but
noooo the template does not support that and I would have to write it in myself.
