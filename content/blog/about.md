Begin the search for a new website, I don't want to host this under my name
that would be selfish for the group, so here we have a new site
[mostdiv.co.uk](https://www.mostdiv.co.uk "This site dummy")
to make everything simpler to find all hosted on a Pi 4 B.

Also the fact that I cannot use icons in the sidebar is driving me up the wall
I would simply like to use the status-online: {{< icon "status-online" >}}
and status-offline: {{< icon "status-offline" >}} icons in the left sidebar but
noooo the template does not support that and I would have to write it in myself.

Anyway here is a list of all the useful links for building this site:
* Hugo framework: [gohugo.io](https://gohugo.io)
* Hextra theme: [imfing.github.io/hextra](https://imfing.github.io/hextra)
* Icon sheet: [heroicons.com](https://v1.heroicons.com)
* Markdown cheatsheet [github.com](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
* YAML to TOML: [transform.tools](https://transform.tools/yaml-to-toml)
