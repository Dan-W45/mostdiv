### Install GDLauncher

If you don't already have it, download [GDLauncher](https://gdlauncher.com/), and go through its setup.

### Add Forge 1.19 instance

* Once GDLauncher is set up, click the "+" in the bottom left.
* Under "Add New Instance", select "Vanilla", then under "Select a version", select "Forge", then "1.19", then "41.1.0".
* Name the instance and finish creating it.
* Run the instance once to allow it to create files/folders, then close.

### Setup Lockout instance

* Once the instance is created, right-click on it, select "Open Folder", then open the "mods" folder in that folder.
* Into the "mods" folder, place [Lockout 1.19v2.9.7.jar](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lockout/files/4655896).
* Launch the instance (may crash first time, if it does, try again. If it crashes repeatedly, check all steps followed).

If you want your skin to load (not just be Steve/Alex), you will also need to place 
[OfflineSkins-1.19-v2.jar](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/offlineskins/files/3879132)
into the same mods folder as the other file.
